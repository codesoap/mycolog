mycolog helps you keep an overview of your mushroom cultivation
projects. It can store notes and pictures for each component, so that
it's easier to remember which experiments succeeded and which failed.
Genetics can be traced through family trees.

# Installation
You can download the precompiled program from the
[releases page](https://github.com/codesoap/mycolog/releases).

In order to get family trees displayed, you need to have Graphviz
installed. You can download it [here](https://graphviz.org/download/).

If you want to compile the program yourself, do this:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:codesoap/mycolog.git
cd mycolog
go install ./cmd/mycolog/
# The binary is now at ~/go/bin/mycolog.
```

Note that cross compilation is not easily possible, because cgo is
used in the sqlite3 driver. An icon can be attached to the Windows
executable file using [rcedit](https://github.com/electron/rcedit):
`rcedit .\mycolog.exe --set-icon .\docs\favicon\favicon.ico`

# Backups
mycolog stores all its data in a single directory called "mycolog".
On Windows you'll find it in your user profile folder, usually
`C:\Users\<your-username>\mycolog\`.

On Linux and other unix-like operating systems, you'll find it inside
`XDG_DATA_HOME`, if this environment variable is set. Otherwise it will
be located at `~/.local/share/mycolog`.
